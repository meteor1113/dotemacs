* Release of "Compat" Version 28.1.1.0

This release mostly fixes a number of smaller bugs that were not
identified as of 28.1.0.0.  Nevertheless these warrent a version bump,
as some of these changes a functional.  These include:

- The addition of the =file-attribute-*= accessor functions.
- The addition of =file-attribute-collect=.
- Improvements to the Texinfo manual (via Jonas Bernoulli's recent
  work on =ox-texinfo=).  For the time being, the Texinfo file is
  maintained in the repository itself, next to the =MANUAL= file.
  This might change in the future.
- Adding a prefix to =string-trim=, =string-trim-left= and
  =string-trim-right= (i.e. now =compat-string-trim=,
  =compat-string-trim-left= and =compat-string-trim-right=)
- Improving the version inference used in the =compat-*= macros.
  This improves the compile-time optimisation that strips away
  functions that are known to be defined for a specific version.
- The addition of generalised variable (=setf=) support for
  =compat-alist-get=.
- The addition of =image-property= and generalised variable support
  for =image-property=.
- The addition of the function =compat-executable-find=.
- The addition of the function =compat-dired-get-marked-files=.
- The addition of the function =exec-path=.
- The addition of the function =make-lock-file-name=.
- The addition of the function =null-device=.
- The addition of the function =time-equal-p=.
- The addition of the function =date-days-in-month=.
- Handling out-of-directory byte compilation better.
- Fixing the usage and edge-cases of =and-let*=.

Furthermore a bug tracker was added: https://todo.sr.ht/~pkal/compat,
which is the preferred way to report issues or feature requests.
General problems, questions, etc. are still better discussed on the
development mailing list: https://lists.sr.ht/~pkal/compat-devel.
