* About this document
  This is explained about self-build of clang-server.
  When you use clang-server binary for distribution on Windows environment, it is not necessary to read this document.

* Step of self-build
  A build of clang-server requires libclang of LLVM.
  Therefore, first self-build is LLVM libclang, next self-build is clang-server.

** LLVM self-build
   You have to do four step of following.
   There is also a script which simplify this work.
   - Checkout LLVM
   - Apply patch to LLVM for libclang
   - Project file generation by CMAKE or configure
   - Build

** clang-server self-build
   Patch applied libclang library use by LLVM self-build
   Use the patch applied libclang library
   - Project file generation by CMAKE
   - Build
   - Installation

* Software required for self-build
** Windows
   The following is required.
*** LLVM
    The following built library is required.
    libclang.lib
    libclang.dll

*** Visual Studio 2017/2015
    any OK
    Before 2013, LLVM was excluded because it became out of support.

*** CMake
    http://www.cmake.org/

    Download cmake archive, and decompress to any location.
    CMake is used for Visual Studio Solution File generation and build and installation.

** Linux
   The following is required.
*** LLVM
    The following built library is required.
    libclang.so

*** CMake
    #+begin_src shell
    $ sudo apt-get install cmake
    #+end_src

    If you want to use latest version, download from following

    http://www.cmake.org/

    e.g.
    Download cmake-X.X.X.tar.gz, and decompress to work directory.
    You perform a build and installation.
    #+begin_src shell
    $ tar -xf cmake-X.X.X.tar.gz .
    $ cd cmake-X.X.X
    $ ./configure && make
    $ make install
    #+end_src

* Self-Build
** Windows
*** LLVM
    Required process for LLVM self-build.
    And you must apply patch to LLVM before build.
    It isn't necessary install a package after self-build.
    You must designate generated binary PATH after LLVM self-build at CMake project generation argument.
    Therefore clang-server is able to build.
    When LLVM is already installed, you must designate installed directory of LLVM.

    When you want to self-build,
    Checkout from SVN by yourself, and perform the LLVM Solution File generation and build by cmake.
    Or, use following script.
    https://github.com/yaruopooner/llvm-build-shells

**** How to designate the LLVM patch in the script
     You will designate -tasks to the argument of builderShell,
     and designate PATCH to the parameter of -tasks,
     It will gives a table that describes the path to apply the patch and patch file to parameter of -patchInfos.
     Please refer to the sample.ps1 of llvm-build-shells for details.

**** The contents of the LLVM patch
     patch details
     https://github.com/yaruopooner/llvm-build-shells/blob/master/patch/details.org

     - Bugfix of clang library.

     - Use of mmap always invalidation.
       https://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=20880

*** clang-server
    Use the ac-clang/build/build.bat
    It's necessary to execute in the command line or Windows Explorer.
    Please edit the build.bat.ini as necessary.
    If build.bat.ini is not found, it will generate from build.bat.ini.template.
    
    - build.bat.ini commentary
      - =CMAKE_PATH=
        path of cmake.exe
      - =LLVM_BUILD_SHELLS_PATH=
        path of llvm-build-shells
      - =HOST_VS_VERSION=
        you use Visual Studio version
      - =TARGET_CLANG_VERSION=
        Clang version
      - =TARGET_ARCH=
        target architecture
      - =TARGET_CONFIG=
        target configuration
      - =CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=
        You have to designate installation location of clang-server.
        If you omit this option, value will be use =C:/Program Files/clang-server= .
      - =CMAKE_TARGET=
        Specify the project name to be executed.
        Project name is generated by cmake.

** Linux
*** LLVM
    Required process for LLVM self-build.
    And you must apply patch to LLVM before build.
    It isn't necessary install a package after self-build.
    You must designate generated binary PATH after LLVM self-build at CMake project generation argument.
    Therefore clang-server is able to build.
    When LLVM is already installed, you must designate installed directory of LLVM.
    
    When you want to self-build,
    Checkout from SVN by yourself, and perform the LLVM Solution File generation and build by cmake.
    Or, use following script.
    https://github.com/yaruopooner/llvm-build-shells
    
**** How to designate the LLVM patch in the script
     You will designate -patch to the argument of executeBuilder.
     Add to -patchApplyLocation the path where you want to apply the patch.
     You write the patch file to -patchPath gives as an parameter.
     -patchApplyLocation,-patchPath becomes the pair, it is possible to multiple times designate.
     Please refer to the sample.sh of llvm-build-shells for details.

**** The contents of the LLVM patch
     Use of mmap always invalidation.

*** clang-server
    Use the ac-clang/build/build.sh
    Please edit the build.sh.opt as necessary.
    If build.sh.opt is not found, it will generate from build.sh.opt.template.

    - build.sh.opt commentary
      - =LLVM_BUILD_SHELLS_PATH=
        path of llvm-build-shells
      - =TARGET_CLANG_VERSION=
        Clang version
      - =TARGET_CONFIG=
        target configuration
      - =CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=
        You have to designate installation location of clang-server.
        If you omit this option, value will be use =/usr/local/bin= .

* Patch was applied binary(Windows Only)
  https://github.com/yaruopooner/ac-clang/releases

  clang-server-X.X.X.zip is you can download from the above
  The archive is 3 files contain, these file applied patch.
   - clang-server.exe
   - libclang.dll

   Please place the above file in the place where PATH passed.
   
   Distribution of libraries that are currently patched has been discontinued.
   If necessary, please self-build.
   +When you want to self-build only clang-server without LLVM+
   +clang-server-X.X.X.zip decompress to ac-clang directory.+
   +Then, it will be placed in the following.+
   +ac-clang/clang-server/binary/clang-server.exe+
   +ac-clang/clang-server/library/x86_64/release/libclang.dll+ 
   +ac-clang/clang-server/library/x86_64/release/libclang.lib+ 

* Restrictions when you use LLVM official libclang without applying a patch
  The problem in this section does not occur when using patched libclang(dll, so).
  When you use the patch does not applied to LLVM self-build and LLVM official binary, this problem is occur.
  This problem has been reported to LLVM bugzilla. in the corresponding waitting.
  https://github.com/yaruopooner/llvm-build-shells/blob/master/patch/details.org

** A specific file is locked and cannot save it
   =Corresponding patch | invalidate-mmap.patch=

   When you try to save the edited header file,
   it will be "basic-save-buffer-2: Opening output file: invalid argument `HEADER-FILE-NAME`",
   and you can't save.
   This occur if it meets certain conditions.
   This condition is met when the header file size is larger than 16kB.
   It is not at all occur when header file size is smaller than 16kB.
   This issue belong to TranslationUnit(TU) of libclang.
   The inclusion target file is locked by TU of libclang.
   By performing a provisional transaction in ac-clang side, the more or less is erased, but it can't be avoided perfectly.
   When this issue is occurring, only manual handle can be avoided.

*** Solution in Emacs side
    I suppose that combination of source file is foo.cpp/foo.hpp.
    When foo.hpp(modified) can't save, foo.cpp is (modified) often, so foo.cpp have to saved.
    Therefore, foo.hpp should be possible to save.
    When this can't save, 
    foo.hpp is included by source files besides foo.cpp, and it has (modified) status.
    You have to save those.
    And, when corresponding source is activated by definition jump feature, even if buffer don't modified that buffer is activated.
    You try remove corresponding buffer, or (ac-clang-deactivate) must be execute in buffer.
    In other cases, when you try save header file that file size larger than 16kB
    When you save a header file of larger than 16kB, if it fails.
    And that header file does not opened.
    In this case, header file is included by a far module from current source file.
    When you having developed a library module framework, it may be easy to occur.
    because library and framework is included from application side.

*** Issue(Implementation issues explanation, it wanted suggested solutions)
    I think that this problem is a specification bug on clang side.

    When session of "foo.cpp" is edited in the buffer,
    TU continue locking to included header file after parsed "foo.cpp".

    When you edit and save to "foo.hpp" in this state, it occur error, because file is locked by mmap.
    
    Therefore I modified a server as follows.
    So while maintaining the session when "foo.cpp" saving, 
    TU is generated when "foo.cpp" is edited after TU released.

    Therefore "foo.hpp" is possible to save that the included header file is unlocked after "foo.cpp" saved.

    When a "foo.hpp" is included buffer where exist in buffer editing group without buffer of "foo.cpp",
    the lock is not released when you does not save all them.


    In the Windows environment,
    This lock is not open function of I/O, is a lock by CreateFileMapping of WindowsAPI.
    libclang FileManager does allocation to memory mapped file for the files larger than 16kB.
    When TU is released, memory mapped file is released by UnmapViewOfFile, these becomes writable to file.
    
    In the Linux environment,
    problems with mmap/munmap bug differ slightly from the Windows environment, but also occurred in Linux environment.
    The method add to "class Foo" in "foo.hpp" in the state that holds TU of "foo.cpp", and save to file.
    After "foo.hpp" update, when you try complete method of "class Foo" in the "foo.cpp", TU will crash.
    in this case, libclang output to STDOUT that "libclang: crash detected in code completion"
    libclang output "libclang: crash detected in code completion" to STDOUT.
    The process of clang-server is living in this situation.
    Completion is possible after deletion of session and creation of session.

** Clang-server crashes on completion
   =Corresponding patch | bugfix000.patch=

   It occurs when completion a specific standard library method.
   Inside libclang cause by out of range access to array.

* Patch commentary
** Patch
   Use the llvm-build-shells/patch/invalidate-mmap.patch
   #+begin_src shell-script
   cd llvm/
   svn patch llvm-build-shells/patch/invalidate-mmap.patch
   #+end_src

** The contents of the LLVM patch(invalidate-mmap.patch)
   Patch is applied so as not to use mmap.
   Apply to the following source code to 
   =clang-trunk/llvm/lib/Support/MemoryBuffer.cpp=

#+begin_src C++
   static error_code getOpenFileImpl(int FD, const char *Filename,
                                  OwningPtr<MemoryBuffer> &result,
                                  uint64_t FileSize, uint64_t MapSize,
                                  int64_t Offset, bool RequiresNullTerminator) {
#+end_src

   It is determined availability of mmap for file by shouldUseMmap call from the above function.

#+begin_src C++
   static bool shouldUseMmap(int FD,
                          size_t FileSize,
                          size_t MapSize,
                          off_t Offset,
                          bool RequiresNullTerminator,
                          int PageSize) {
#+end_src
   When the result of function is always false, mmap is not never used.
   Therefore, the following modify has been applied to the top of this function.
#+begin_src C++
  #if 1
  return false;
  #else
  /* original codes */
  #endif
#+end_src

** TODO Additional Specification of LLVM3.5
   IsVolatileSize has been added to arguments of shouldUseMmap and getOpenFileImpl.
   This will be passed unchanged to shouldUseMmap.

   It is executed as follows in the shouldUseMmap top.
#+begin_src C++
   if (IsVolatileSize)
      return false;
#+end_src

   Following comments had been attached
#+begin_src C++
   // mmap may leave the buffer without null terminator if the file size changed
   // by the time the last page is mapped in, so avoid it if the file size is
   // likely to change.
#+end_src

   Although that said, there is a situation which isn't assumed Variously, I'm supposing that mistake of specification.
   Moreover, upstream function of buffer association function
   I was found some place where is not designated value of IsVolatileSize and is used default value of constructor argument.
   I tried modified it.
   Result was become more better than conventional.
   But it seem to have a problem, because I was not able to control mmap like a assumption.
   I'm not enough understand the specification of around the file system and memory of LLVM.
   For that reason that the rightly correction is difficult.
   Therefore, the above patching becomes the most safe way at present.
