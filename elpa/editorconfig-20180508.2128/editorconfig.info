1.1 Installation
================

Download the EditorConfig C Core
(https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-core-c) and follow the
instructions in the README and INSTALL files to install it.

This plugin also has a built-in core library implemented in Emacs-Lisp,
and fallback to it when no core executable is found.

In either case, copy ‘.el’ files in this repository to ‘~/.emacs.d/lisp’
and add the following to your ‘~/.emacs’ file:

(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp")
(require 'editorconfig)
(editorconfig-mode 1)

Alternatively, you can find the package available on MELPA
(http://melpa.org/#/editorconfig) and MELPA Stable
(http://stable.melpa.org/#/editorconfig) (The Marmalade package
(http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/editorconfig) is deprecated).

Or if you use *use-package*
(https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/UsePackage):

(use-package editorconfig
  :ensure t
  :config
  (editorconfig-mode 1))

1.2 Supported properties
========================

Current Emacs plugin coverage for EditorConfig’s properties
(http://editorconfig.org/#supported-properties):

   • ‘indent_style’
   • ‘indent_size’
   • ‘tab_width’
   • ‘end_of_line’
   • ‘charset’
   • ‘trim_trailing_whitespace’
   • ‘insert_final_newline = true’ is supported
   • ‘insert_final_newline = false’ is not enforced (as in trailing
     newlines actually being removed automagically), we just
     buffer-locally override any preferences that would auto-add them to
     files ‘.editorconfig’ marks as trailing-newline-free
   • ‘max_line_length’
   • ‘file_type_emacs’ (Experimental)
   • ‘root’ (only used by EditorConfig core)

Not yet covered properties marked with over-strike – pull requests
implementing missing features warmly welcomed!  Typically, you will want
to tie these to native functionality, or the configuration of existing
packages handling the feature.

As several packages have their own handling of, say, indention, we might
not yet cover some mode you use, but we try to add the ones that show up
on our radar.  Similarly, we don’t yet hook in to all different packages
for whitespace trimming to inform them about editorconfig settings, but
aim for better coverage of things like ws-trim
(ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/emacs/ws-trim.el).

This plugin also has an experimental support for ‘file_type_emacs’,
which specifies “file types” for files.  As for Emacs, it means
‘major-mode’ can be specified: for example, when ‘file_type_emacs’ is
set to ‘markdown’ for ‘a.txt’, ‘markdown-mode’ will be enabled when
opening ‘a.txt’.  This property is experimental and its meaning might
change in the future updates.

1.3 Customize
=============

* Menu:

* editorconfig-custom-hooks::
* editorconfig-indentation-alist::
* editorconfig-exec-path::
* editorconfig-get-properties-function::


File: editorconfig.info,  Node: editorconfig-custom-hooks,  Next: editorconfig-indentation-alist,  Up: Customize

1.3.1 ‘editorconfig-custom-hooks’
---------------------------------

A list of custom hooks after loading common EditorConfig settings, where
you can set some custom variables or overwrite existing properties.

For example, ‘web-mode’ has several variables for indentation offset
size and EditorConfig sets them at once by ‘indent_size’.  You may want
to stop indenting only blocks of ‘web-mode’: it can be achieved by
adding following to your init.el:

(add-hook 'editorconfig-custom-hooks
  (lambda (hash) (setq web-mode-block-padding 0)))

You can also define your own custom properties and enable them here.

1.3.2 ‘editorconfig-indentation-alist’
--------------------------------------

Alist of indentation setting methods by modes.

For the easiest case to add a new support for a major-mode, you just
need to add a pair of major-mode symbol and its indentation variables:

(add-to-list 'editorconfig-indentation-alist
  ;; Just an example, of course EditorConfig has already included this setting!
  '(c-mode c-basic-offset))

You can also modify this variable with the command M-x
customize-variable [RET] editorconfig-indentation-alist [RET]. For a bit
more complicated cases please take a look at the docstring of this
variable.


File: editorconfig.info,  Node: editorconfig-exec-path,  Next: editorconfig-get-properties-function,  Prev: editorconfig-indentation-alist,  Up: Customize

1.3.3 ‘editorconfig-exec-path’
------------------------------

String of ‘editorconfig’ executable name (command name or full path to
the executable).


File: editorconfig.info,  Node: editorconfig-get-properties-function,  Prev: editorconfig-exec-path,  Up: Customize

1.3.4 ‘editorconfig-get-properties-function’
--------------------------------------------

Function to use to get EditorConfig properties.

For example, if you always want to use built-in core library instead of
any EditorConfig executable to get properties, add following to your
init.el:

(set-variable 'editorconfig-get-properties-function
              #'editorconfig-core-get-properties-hash)

Possible known values are:

   • ‘editorconfig-get-properties’ (default)
        • Use ‘editorconfig-get-properties-from-exec’ when
          ‘editorconfig-exec-path’ executable is found, otherwise use
          ‘editorconfig-core-get-properties-hash’

   • ‘editorconfig-get-properties-from-exec’
        • Get properties by executing EditorConfig executable specified
          in ‘editorconfig-exec-path’

   • ‘editorconfig-core-get-properties-hash’
        • Always use built-in Emacs-Lisp implementation to get
          properties
