;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Contains functions for settings the ECB layout.
;;
;; This file is part of the ECB package which can be found at:
;; http://ecb.sourceforge.net

;; This file has been re-implemented by Klaus Berndl <klaus.berndl@sdm.de>.
;; What has been done:
;; Completely rewritten the layout mechanism for better customizing, adding
;; new layouts, better redrawing and more straightforward code.
;; 1. Now all user-layouting is done by customizing the new option
;;    `ecb-layout-name' or by the command `ecb-change-layout'. The function
;;    `ecb-redraw-layout' (formally known as 'ecb-set-layout) can still be
;;    called interactively. But it just redraws the layout specified in
;;    `ecb-layout-name'. All changes to the layout must be made by customizing
;;    this new option. Please read the very detailed comment of
;;    `ecb-layout-name'!
;; 2. Adding new layouts is now much easier and more straightforward: We have
;;    now a main core-layout function (`ecb-redraw-layout-full') which is the
;;    "environment" for the specific "layout-functions". The core function
;;    does first some layout independent actions, then calls the
;;    "layout-function" for the name which has been set in `ecb-layout-name'
;;    and after that it does some layout independent actions again (see the
;;    comments in this function). See the macro `ecb-layout-define' and the
;;    command `ecb-create-new-layout'!
;;
;; Background-info: For each layout-type (ecb-windows left, right, top and
;; left-right) there is one function:
;; 'ecb-delete-window-ecb-windows-[left|right|top|leftright]'.
;; These functions follow these guide-lines:
;; - Preconditions for these functions:
;;   + the edit-area is splitted - at least in two edit-windows
;;   + The function gets two arguments: The window to delete (if nil then the
;;     current window has to be deleted) and the list of all current
;;     edit-windows.
;;   + These functions are always(!) called with deactivated advices of
;;     `delete-window' function.
;;   + These functions can only use `delete-window' of the set of maybe
;;     adviced window functions, because of a bug in advice.el only one
;;     functionï¾´s advice can be deactivated within a advice itself!
;; - What must they do: Doing the appropriate action (e.g.
;;   `ecb-delete-window-ecb-windows-left' must delete the window. This action
;;   must be done appropriate for the current ECB-layout type (see
;;   postconditions)
;; - Postcondition of these functions:
;;   + The named edit-window must be deleted and all ecb-windows in the
;;     ecb-frame must have the layout like before the delete.
;;   + If the current window has been deleted then point must reside after
;;     deletion in the next edit-window in a circular meaning (i.e. if the
;;     last edit-window has been deleted, point must stay afterwards in the
;;     first edit-window). If a window unequal the current window has been
;;     deleted point must stay in the window before deletion at the same
;;     place.
;;
;; New adviced intelligent window-functions as replacement for these originals:
;; - `other-window'
;; - `delete-window'
;; - `delete-other-windows'
;; - `delete-windows-on'
;; - `split-window-horizontally'
;; - `split-window-vertically'
;; - `split-window'
;; - `display-buffer'
;; - `switch-to-buffer'
;; - `switch-to-buffer-other-window'
;; - `other-window-for-scrolling'
;; - `balance-windows'
;; The behavior of the adviced functions is:
;; - All these function behaves exactly like their corresponding original
;;   functions but they always act as if the edit-window(s) of ECB would be the
;;   only window(s) of the ECB-frame. So the edit-window(s) of ECB seems to be
;;   a normal Emacs-frame to the user.
;; - If a persistent compile-window is used all buffers for which
;;   `ecb-compilation-buffer-p' returns not nil are handled in the
;;   compile-window!

If you want a compilation window shown at the bottom of the ECB-layout
then set here the height of it \(Default is a height of 5). If you redraw the
current layout with `ecb-redraw-layout' then the compilation window (if any)
has the height you set here. If the number is less than 1.0 the height is a
fraction of the frame height.

If you do not set a persistent compilation window then doing a compilation or
displaying temp-buffers \(e.g. *Help*-buffers) splits temporally the edit
window vertically if the edit window is not splitted already or uses another
edit window temporally for compilation output if the edit window is already
splitted. This is the recommended value for this option because this is the
standard-behavior of Emacs.

Beware: If you set a persistent compilation window then ECB displays all buffers
for which `ecb-compilation-buffer-p' returns not nil in that persistent
compilation window. If a buffer which should being displayed there is not
displayed there then try to modify the options `ecb-compilation-buffer-names',
`ecb-compilation-major-modes' or `ecb-compilation-predicates' \(in this
sequence).

See also the options `ecb-compile-window-temporally-enlarge' and
`ecb-enlarged-compilation-window-max-height' and also the command
`ecb-toggle-compile-window-height'!

ECB offers the functionality of such a persistent compile-window regardless if
the special ECB-windows are visible or not \(see the command
`ecb-toggle-ecb-windows').

Selecting a node in a maximized tree-window is handled very smart by ECB:

If a tree-buffer-name is not contained in this option then selecting a node in
this maximized tree-buffer automatically \"minimizes\" that tree-window \(i.e.
displays all windows of the current layout) so the user can perform the next
logical step \(e.g. the next logical step after selecting a directory in the
directories-buffer is to select a source-file - therefore the sources-buffer
of current layout has to be displayed - if the current layout contains one;
the next logical step of selecting a source-file is probably to jump to a
certain tag via the methods-buffer).

If a tree-buffer-name is contained in this option then selecting a node in
this tree-buffer automatically maximizes the next logical tree-window \(e.g.
directories --> sources, sources/history --> methods). But if the current
maximized tree-buffer is also contained in the option
`ecb-tree-do-not-leave-window-after-select' \(see also the tree-buffer-command
`ecb-toggle-do-not-leave-window-after-select' which is bound to `C-t' in each
tree-buffer) then ECB does *not* maximize the next logical tree-window but
point stays in the currently maximized tree-buffer so for example the user can
select more than one node \(e.g. more than one source-file from the
sources-buffer.

The tree-buffer-name can either be defined as plain string or with a symbol
which contains the buffer-name as value. The latter one is recommended for the
builtin ECB-tree-buffers because then simply the related option-symbol can be
used \(e.g. `ecb-directories-buffer-name', `ecb-sources-buffer-name' or
`ecb-history-buffer-name').

In future versions this option will probably also allow to define the next
logical tree-buffer for a tree-buffer - currently this is hard-coded as
follows:
- directories --next-logical--> sources
- sources     --next-logical--> methods
- history     --next-logical--> methods."

Some remarks to the value 'before-activation: If this value has been set then
ECB needs four permanent adivces even when ECB is deactivated: `split-window',
`delete-window', `delete-other-windows' and `set-window-configuration'. But
these advices do not change any behavior of these functions but only storing
in an internal ECB-variable the facts that a window has been splitted or
deleted etc. In addition to this these advices are 100% error-save, means the
functionality of the original functions will be performed in every\(!) case
even if within the advice an error occurs \(but normally there can no errors
occur in these advices because they are very simple). Conclusion: If you want
really all ECB-advices being disabled after deactivating ECB then you have to
set this option to other values then 'before-activation. But setting this

ECB will cycle through all windows of the ECB-frame or scroll simply
the next window in the ECB-frame, means it behaves like the original
`other-window' rsp. the original `other-window-for-scrolling'.

'only-edit:

ECB will only cycle through the edit-windows of ECB or only
scroll another edit-window. If the selected window is not an edit-window
then it behaves like with value 'all.

'edit-and-compile:

Like 'only-edit plus the compile window if any. If the
selected window is neither an edit-window nor the compile-window then it
behaves like with value 'all.

'smart:

With this setting ECB tries to choose the `other-window'-destination or the
\"other window\" to scroll in a smart and intuitive way: If point is in one of
the edit-windows and if the edit-area is splitted then always the \"next\"
edit-window is choosen \(whereas the next edit-window of the last edit-window
is the first edit-window)- if the edit-area is unsplitted then the
compile-window is used if there is one. In the context of an
`other-window'-call the ARG of `other-window' will be taken into account.

If one of the special ecb-windows is selected then always the \"next\"
ecb-window is choosen \(whereas the next ecb-window of the last ecb-window is
the first ecb-window). In the context of an `other-window'-call the ARG of
`other-window' will be taken into account. If there is only one ecb-window
then ECB considers also the edit-windows!

If the compile-window is selected then always the last selected edit-window
will be used unless `other-window' has been called with a prefix-argument
unequal 1.

If there is an active minibuffer:

Regardless of the allowed values above ECB handles the situation of an active
minibuffer during a call to `other-window' or `scroll-other-window' like
follows:

If the minibuffer-window is selected then ECB always chooses the window
`minibuffer-scroll-window' points to \(when this variable is set, otherwise
the compile-window or the last selected edit-window is choosen) when the
called command is called to choose the 1. next window \(always true for
scrolling another window or true when `other-window' called without prefix-arg
or with prefix-arg equal 1). Otherwise the window ARG steps away is choosen
\(in case of `other-window).

If there is an active minibuffer but the minibuffer-window is not selected
then `other-window' and `scroll-other-window' behave like the original
version.

In addition to the allowed values above the value of this option can also be a
function:

This function gets seven arguments:
1. A canonical list of all currently visible windows of the `ecb-frame'
2. A canonical list of all currently visible edit-windows
3. A canonical list of all currently visible ecb-windows
4. The window-object of the compile-window if there is any.
5. The minibuffer-window of the ECB-frame if there is an active minibuffer.
5. The result of the function `ecb-where-is-point' - see the documentation
   of this function for details.
6. An integer which indicates how many steps away from the current selected
   window the \"other-window\ is. Is nil when this function is called in
   another context then for `other-window'.
The function has to return a window-object which is then used as \"other
window\" for the command `other-window' or for scrolling another window
\(e.g. with `scroll-other-window').

This function has to handle all properly situations for itself.
`ecb-get-other-window-smart' is an example for such a function."

  "*Specifies the sizes of the ECB windows for each layout.
The easiest way \(and also the very strongly recommended way) to set this
option is to change the window sizes by dragging the window borders using
the mouse and then store the window sizes by calling the command
`ecb-store-window-sizes'. Next time the layout is redrawn the values stored in
this option will be used.

If `ecb-store-window-sizes' is used then the windows sizes are stored per
default as fractions of current frame-width and -height of the ecb-frame, so
the stored values will \"work\" for other frame sizes too. But if you call
`ecb-store-window-sizes' with a prefix-argument then the fixed values of
current width and height are stored!

If this option is set \"by hand\" \(i.e. not by `ecb-store-window-sizes') then
the following is important:
- Use always `customize-option', never `setq'!
- It is recommended to use fractions of frame-width and -height!.
- It is also recommended to use buffer-name-symbols instead of plain
  buffer-names \(e.g. ecb-history-buffer-name instead of \" *ECB History*\")
- There must be an entry for each special ecb-buffer of that layout for which
  the sizes are stored.
- The order of the sequence of the inserted window sizes doesn't matter
  because each size-pair is assigned to a buffer-name the sizes belong to."

;; Macro for easy defining new layouts
(defmacro ecb-layout-define (name type doc &rest create-code)
  "Creates a new ECB-layout with name NAME which must be a string. TYPE is the
type of the new layout and is literal, i.e. not evaluated. It can be left,
right, top or left-right. DOC is the docstring for the new layout-function
\"ecb-layout-function-<name>\". CREATE-CODE is all the lisp code which is
necessary to define the ECB-windows/buffers. This macro adds the layout with
NAME and TYPE to the internal variable `ecb-available-layouts'.

Preconditions for CREATE-CODE:
1. Current frame is splitted at least in one edit-window and the column\(s)
   (for layout types left, right and left-right) rsp. row \(for a top layout)
   for the special ECB-windows/buffers. Depending on the value of the option
   `ecb-compile-window-height' there is also a compile window at the bottom of
   the frame which is stored in `ecb-compile-window'.

2. All windows are not dedicated.

3. Neither the edit-window nor the compile-window \(if there is one) are
   selected for types left, right and top. For type left-right the left
   column-window is selected.

4. All ECB-advices for the functions in `ecb-layout-basic-adviced-functions' are
   disabled!

Things CREATE-CODE has to do:
1. Splitting the ECB-windows-column\(s)/row \(s.a.) in all the ECB-windows the
   layout should contain \(e.g. directories, sources, methods and history).
   The split must not be done with other functions than `ecb-split-hor' and
   `ecb-split-ver'! It is recommended not to to use a \"hard\" number of
   split-lines or -columns but using fractions between -0.9 and +0.9! Tip: It
   is recommended to spilt from right to left and from bottom to top or with
   other words: First create the right-most and bottom-most special windows!

2. Making each special ECB-window a dedicated window. This can be done with
   one of the following functions:
   + `ecb-set-directories-buffer'
   + `ecb-set-sources-buffer'
   + `ecb-set-methods-buffer'
   + `ecb-set-history-buffer'
   + `ecb-set-speedbar-buffer'
   + `ecb-set-analyse-buffer'
   + `ecb-set-symboldef-buffer'
   Each layout can only contain one of each tree-buffer-type!

   In addition to these functions there is a general macro:
   + `defecb-window-dedicator-to-ecb-buffer':
   This macro defines a so called \"window-dedicator\" which is a function
   registered at ECB and called by ECB to perform any arbitrary code in
   current window and makes the window autom. dedicated at the end. This can
   be used by third party packages like JDEE to create arbitrary ECB-windows
   besides the standard tree-windows.

   To make a special ECB-window a dedicated window for an
   ecb-buffer either one of the seven functions above must be used
   or a new \"window-dedicator\"-function has to be defined with
   `defecb-window-dedicator-to-ecb-buffer' and must be used within the
   layout-definition.

3. Every\(!) special ECB-window must be dedicated as described in 2.

4. CREATE-CODE must work correctly regardless if there is already a
   compile-window \(stored in `ecb-compile-window') or not
   \(`ecb-compile-window' is nil)

Things CREATE-CODE can do or can use:
1. Using the values of `ecb-compile-window-height', `ecb-windows-width',
   `ecb-windows-height' and `ecb-compile-window-width'.

Things CREATE-CODE must NOT do:
1. Splitting the edit-window
2. Creating a compile-window
3. Deleting the edit-window, the compile-window \(if there is any) or the
   ECB-windows-column\(s)/row \(see Precondition 1.)
4. Referring to the values of `ecb-edit-window' or `ecb-compile-window'
   because these values are always nil or undefined during CREATE-CODE.
5. Using the function `ecb-compile-window-live-p'.

Postconditions for CREATE-CODE:
1. The edit-window must be the selected window and must not be dedicated.
2. Every window besides the edit-window \(and the compile-window) must be
   a dedicated window \(e.g. a ECB-tree-window)."

Do not call this command from elisp-program but only interactively!

Called without a prefix-argument the state of the ECB-frame-layout will

- The state of compile-window \(hidden or visible) will be preserved but if
  visible then the height will be as specified in `ecb-compile-window-height'.
- The state of the ECB-windows will be preserved \(hidden or visible) but if
  visible then the sizes will be as specified in the layout \(and with the
  options `ecb-windows-width' and `ecb-windows-height') or as stored with
  `ecb-store-window-sizes'.

If called with ONE prefix-argument \(\[C-u]) then the layout will be drawn
with all ECB-windows and also with a visible compile-window \(when
`ecb-compile-window-height' is not nil). The splitting-state of the edit-area
will be preserved.

If called with TWO prefix-arguments \(i.e. hitting \[C-u] twice: \[C-u]
\[C-u]) then an emergency-redraw will be performed. This means the same as if
called with one prefix-argument \(s.a.) but the splitting-state of the
edit-area will NOT be preserved but all edit-windows besides the current one
will be deleted. Use this only if there are some anomalies after standard
redraws!

If the variable `ecb-redraw-layout-quickly' is not nil then the redraw is done
by the `ecb-redraw-layout-quickly' function, otherwise by
`ecb-redraw-layout-full'.

Please note: It's strongly recommended to use the quick redraw only if you have
really slow machines where a full redraw takes several seconds because the
quick redraw is not really safe and has some annoying drawbacks! On normal
machines the full redraw should be done in << 1s so there should be no need
for the quick version!"
