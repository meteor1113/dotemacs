;;; TODO:
;;
;; - What is the pattern we should use for cycling through other windows?
;;
;;   - ecb-cycle-through-X-buffers (select the next X buffer)
;;   - ecb-cycle-switch-to-X-buffer (set the X buffer using completion)
;;
;; - How do we setup the menubar?
;;
;;          - ECB
;;                Cycle
;;                     - Forward Compilation Buffer
;;                     - Set Compilation Buffer
;;
;; - What do we use for key bindings?
;;
;; - We need an easier way to setup completion and a better way to get the
;;   index.
;;
;; - If possible, try to put fit the buffer so that the end of buffer is at the
;; end of the window... if necessary.
