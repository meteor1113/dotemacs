;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Contains the code for some examples mentioned in the online-help.
;; This is a full working layout-example to demonstrate how to program
;; complete new special windows/buffers, add them to a layout and synchronize
;; it with the edit-window of ECB.
;;
;; To test this example just do:
;; 1. Start ECB 
;; 2. Load ecb-examples.el into (X)Emacs: (require 'ecb-examples)
;; 3. Call `ecb-show-layout-help' and insert "example-layout1" as layout name
;;    to see the outline of the test layout and get information about the
;;    special windows of this layout.
;; 4. Call `ecb-examples-activate'.
;; 5. Play around with the new layout and test it.
;; 6. Call `ecb-examples-deactivate'.
;;
;; The intention of this example is to be a skeleton and pattern for other
;; packages which want to use the layout-engine of ECB do display their own
;; information. For example graphical debuggers (like JDEbug of JDEE) could be
;; made this way.

;;; History
;;
;; For the ChangeLog of this file see the CVS-repository. For a complete
;; history of the ECB-package see the file NEWS.

Preconditions for such a hook:
- Current buffer is the buffer of the currently selected
  edit-window.
- The bufferinfo-buffer is displayed in a visible window of the
  ecb-frame \(so no check for visibilty of the bufferinfo-buffer in
  the ecb-frame is necessary in a hook function)

Postcondition for such a hook:
Point must stay in the same edit-window as before evaluating the hook.

Important note: If the option
`ecb-examples-bufferinfo-buffer-sync' is not nil the function
`ecb-examples-bufferinfo-buffer-sync' is running either every
time Emacs is idle or even after every command \(see
`ecb-examples-bufferinfo-buffer-sync-delay'). So if the
bufferinfo-buffer is displayed in a window of the ecb-frame \(see
preconditions above) these hooks can be really called very often!
Therefore each function of this hook should/must check in an
efficient way at beginning if its task have to be really
performed and then do them only if really necessary! Otherwise
performance of Emacs could slow down dramatically!"
