;;; Commentary:

;; This extension mainly adds the following extra features:
;;   - Chinese localizations
;;   - Display holiday, lunar, horoscope, zodiac, solar term info on mode line
;;   - Define holidays using `holiday-lunar', `holiday-solar-term'
;;   - Highlight holidays based on different priorities
;;   - Add `cal-china-x-chinese-holidays', `cal-china-x-japanese-holidays'.
;;   - custom week diary(like weeks in school)
;;
;; To use, add something like the following to your .emacs:
;;     (require 'cal-china-x)
;;     (setq mark-holidays-in-calendar t)
;;     (setq cal-china-x-important-holidays cal-china-x-chinese-holidays)
;;     (setq cal-china-x-general-holidays '((holiday-lunar 1 15 "元宵节")))
;;     (setq calendar-holidays
;;           (append cal-china-x-important-holidays
;;                   cal-china-x-general-holidays
;;                   other-holidays))
;;
;; Note: for emacs22, please use version 1.1.

;;; History

;; This is an early derived work from `chinese-calendar.el' written by
;; Charles Wang <charleswang@peoplemail.com.cn>.

;;; Note:

;; - Display week day(the first line of each month) in chinese properly
;;   It is a bit difficult to do nice alignment since it depends on the font
;;   size of chinese characters and numbers. But some manages to do it:
;;     https://github.com/xwl/cal-china-x/issues/3

;;; Code:

(require 'calendar)
(require 'holidays)
(require 'cal-china)
(require 'cl-lib)
