Like `holiday-fixed', but with LUNAR-MONTH and LUNAR-DAY.

When there are multiple days(like Run Yue or 闰月, e.g.,
2006-08-30, which is 07-07 in lunar calendar, the chinese
valentine's day), we use NUM to define which day(s) as
holidays. The rules are:

NUM = 0, only the earlier day.
NUM = 1, only the later day.
NUM with other values(default), all days(maybe one or two).

emacs23 introduces a similar `holiday-chinese', a quick test
shows that it does not recognize Run Yue at all.
